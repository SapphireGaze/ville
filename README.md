- Implemented a robust REST API server with a SQLite database for efficient storage of user and track information.
- Made use of JSON web tokens and customized Nuxt.js middleware for secure user session and resources management.
- Implemented data streaming when audio file is playing for continuous data transfer with low-latency processing, reduced processing speed by up to 70%.
